				Coos Bay Fire Department

				<h3>
  				A career firefighter, Capt. Randy E. Carpenter, 46, died November 25, 2002, when the burning roof of a business in downtown Coos Bay collapsed.  Randy had been a firefighter for a total of 23 years, beginning his career as a volunteer, then moved to a position as a full-time firefighter with the Baker City Fire Department, before moving to the Coos Bay Fire Department in February 1989. He was Baker City"s 1983 "Firefighter of the Year", and Coos Bay"s 1991 "Firefighter of the Year". He was also Coos Bay"s 1999 "EMT of the Year".
  				</h3>
  				<h3>
  				Randy's interest in firefighting began early in his life when he would accompany his father, a volunteer firefighter for Baker City for 46 years, to the firestation. During the time he was a volunteer, Randy was very active in the Oregon Volunteer Firefighter Association and served in all State Association offices, including president. Randy was a consummate professional and was highly qualified in all operational and procedural aspects of his job. He was part of the original efforts to bring a hazardous materials unit to Coos Bay and was a specialist in HAZMAT. He was qualified and certified to teach all subjects of firefighting and regularly taught courses in CPR and EMT Basic at the local college in Coos Bay. He took great pride in his job and treasured the trust and respect of all his firefighter brethren. He was an active member of the International Association of Firefighters, IAFF, Local 2935 (serving as President in 1991), and the Regional Hazardous Materials Team. He was also skilled in construction and built a successful contracting business with his good friend Jim Bush.
  				</h3>
  				<h3>
  				The love of family was very foremost in Randy's life. He was so proud of and totally dedicated to his two girls, Sarah and Stephanie, with priority in providing for their needs. His parents, Wayne and Dru, three brothers, Kerry, Brad, and Jeff, their spouses and families also survived him.
  				</h3>
  				<h3>
  				Randy was usually very successful when he took his boat out "crabbing", and was always happy when he could take time to go water-skiing, at which he was very adept. He especially loved spending time in Eastern Oregon (Dad & Mom referred to him as their "homing pigeon") where he would hunt deer, elk, and antelope, along with working with longtime friends on the Bunch Ranch near Durkee. While Randy had a wonderful sense of humor and enjoyed playing a practical joke, he never wanted the limelight, just a way to be of help. His honesty and integrity were unquestionable. All his family and his countless friends who were like family to him will miss Randy beyond description.

				HISTORY OF THE FOUNDATION
				</h2>
				<h3>
				On November 25th of 2002 the community of Coos Bay OR. suffered a tragic loss when three of their local firefighters lost their lives in the line of duty. Randy Carpenter, Jeff Common, and Chuck Hanners all gave their lives as heroes serving their community while fighting a fire in a local auto parts store. After the roof of the store collapsed, the fire was extinguished, and the smoke had cleared, three families and a community mourned their great loss.
				</h3>
				<h3>
				Of course, as with any accident, many questions arose, most asked without answer. Was there something that could have been done to prevent this horrible event? In response, the family and friends of Randy Carpenter have established a foundation in memory of their son, brother, father, uncle, and friend. Everything we do is done with the hopes of helping to prevent future tragic loss of firefighter's lives.
				</h3>
				<h3>
				Randy believed strongly in training and would often state, "Preparation is the separation between a good firefighter and the best!" Continuing in this belief the Randy Carpenter Memorial Foundation is dedicated to the education and preparation of firefighters everywhere.
				</h3>

				PURPOSE OF THE FOUNDATION
				</h2>
				<h3>
				Although accidents will happen and firefighters will lose their lives in the line of duty, the goal of our foundation is to have a resource available for the men and women of the fire service to better prepare themselves for the dangers of their job. Throughout the Northwest firefighters are going untrained due to lack of funding, and this is unacceptable. By offering scholarships for educational seminars, instruction, and training material, it is our hope to equip as many firefighters as possible to help reduce the unnecessary injuries and deaths occurring in the fire service.
				</h3>
				<h3>
				Fire education and training was one of the most important parts of Randy's life as a member of the community and as a firefighter.
				</h3>
				<h3>
				Randy was known across the entire state of Oregon and beyond as a dedicated educator and source of fire and emergency response information.
				</h3>
				<h3>
				To continue his legacy we have established a foundation dedicated to providing financial assistance in accessing fire and emergency medical education for fire fighters interested in furthering their knowledge, experience and capabilities.
				</h3>
				<h3>
				Assistance may include, but is not limited to, tuition fees, materials, instructor expense, support for participant loss of income and/or travel costs, at the discretion of the Foundation Board of Directors.
